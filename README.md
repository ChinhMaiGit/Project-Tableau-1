# Tableau Project 1: Superstore Sales
An exploratory analysis on the effect of discounts on sales profit
 
## Case description

This is the practice project that I prepare for my Tableau course on Coursera. In a hypothetical scenario, I am an analyst working for the Super Store Corporation. My boss Sylvia is the VP of Sales and she is conducting a review of the company discount policy. As research for her review, she has asked me to perform an exploratory analysis of the Super Store discount data. Specifically, Sylvia has asked me to investigate if there is a relationship between discounted sales and profit, and how much the company is profiting or losing based on discounted sales

## Objectives

* Perform an exploratory analysis of the Super Store discount data
* Investigate if there is a relationship between discounted sales and profits
* Investigate by how much the company is profiting or losing based on discounted sales
* Investigate the efficiencies of how discounts are handled, (1) by individuals, and (2) by product segments
